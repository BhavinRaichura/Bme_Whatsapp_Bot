# Bme_Whatsapp_Bot
I have made this bot for my college. It is a WhatsApp bot that is connected to a database that has some collection that contains information related to new updates, time table, upcoming events etc. When someone needs something he will call this bot and the bot will search for keywords and actions, and return the data accordingly.
